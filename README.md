# Gnome-Move-Clock
Gnome extension based on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2/move-clock/ 

Started with the move clock extension from http://frippery.org/extensions/

I prefer to have it on the right, and it also removes the "activities" menu.

* Installation *

create a folder in "~/.local/share/gnome/extensions/"
Place these files in that folder and enable with gnome tweak tool.
